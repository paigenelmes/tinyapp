# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). This app was created by Paige Nelmes as part of my learning with Lighthouse Labs. 

## Final Product

!["To get started, create a free account. Registration is quick and easy."](#)

!["Once you're registered and logged in, TinyApp stores all your short URLs in one place."](#)

!["You also can edit or delete any URL that you've created."](#)

!["TinyApp is responsive! No matter how big or small your browser window is, the app will look great."](#)
