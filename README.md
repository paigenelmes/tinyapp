# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). This app was created by Paige Nelmes as part of my learning with Lighthouse Labs. 

NOTE: This project was created for learning purposes. It is <strong>not</strong> intended for use in production-grade software.
